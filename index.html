    <p>The National Zoo is one of the only places in the US where you can find a panda. While they mostly sleep and eat, these fascinating creatures have become a symbol of the National Zoo. They can choose to be outside or inside. The heat of DC summers is hard for the pandas, but the zoo installed air conditioned grottos and misting sprays so they are able to stay outside in the summer if they choose.</p>
    <p>Any cubs born at the National Zoo belong to China and are sent back at four years old. The last cub born was Bei Bei in 2015, who was named by both the First Lady of the United States and the First Lady of the People's Republic of China.
